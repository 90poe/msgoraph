A zero dependency Go Client for [Microsoft's Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/overview). This is built and distributed under all of the philosophies of [vgo](https://research.swtch.com/vgo) for future compatibility.

## Compatibility Warning

This library is in **pre-release**, which means the Go Import Compatibility Rule does not apply. It will remain that way until we have a solid number of operations and types implemented.

## Supported Operations

- `List Users`
- `Get User`
